# Threat-Actor-Profiles
Welcome to Threat Actor Profiles, a weekly series of structured threat-intelligence reports. Instead of lengthy, conventional whitepapers, each profile is designed to be:

- Concise & Practical  
  Every profile goes straight to the point and focuses on what defenders need to know.

- Actionable  
  Each section is crafted so that security teams can quickly integrate findings into detection, hunting, and response playbooks.

- Consistently Structured  
  We use the same format for every actor, so you always know where to find critical details.

### What’s Inside Each Profile?

1. Actor Background & Identity  
   - Who they are (aliases, origin, operator model)  
   - How they were first discovered

2. Motivations & Targeting Patterns  
   - Primary objectives (financial, political, espionage)  
   - Typical verticals and geographies of interest

3. Tactics, Techniques & Toolsets (TTPs)  
   - Initial access vectors  
   - Privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence  
   - Tools, malware families, custom frameworks

4. Notable Campaigns & Incidents  
   - High-profile breaches and ransom events  
   - Publicized ransom demands, leak sites, extortion methods

5. Defensive Considerations  
   - Key indicators (IoCs) to monitor  
   - Detection tips (log events, unusual behaviors)  
   - Mitigation recommendations (patching, segmentation, hardening)

### Why This Series Is Different

- Beyond IoCs: Instead of dumping dozens of indicators at once, we focus on understanding the actor’s “why” and “how” so you can anticipate future moves.
- Uniform Format: By following the same template each week, readers can compare actors side by side and quickly onboard new team members.
- Timely Updates: Profiles are published every Tuesday. Each entry reflects the latest publicly available intelligence, combined with hands-on analysis.
